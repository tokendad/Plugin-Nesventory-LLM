		<td class="auto-style14"><span class="auto-style10">	On a snowy winter night, in the late 1970’s, a group of friends embarked on a holiday outing that would magically change not only their lives, but the lives of countless individuals that they did not even know for generations to come.  For as they rounded a bend in the road that night, they reached their destination, the quaint little town of Stillwater, Minnesota.  Bedecked in its holiday finery and festive lights, it rekindled thoughts and feelings of Christmas long ago.  For the remainder of the evening, the friends recalled the warm holiday memories that had been stirred by the little community all aglow.  From this innocent outing and a little foresight, The Original Snow Village Collection was born.  

		<br />
		<br />
		Ed Bazinet, who would later become the first President and CEO of Department 56, was one of those present that night.  He oversaw a division of Bachman’s, a Minneapolis retail florist, which had passed through several generations of a prominent local family.  Bachman’s, long recognized as a leader in the floral industry, is synonymous with quality service, innovative concepts, its signature purple gift-wrap and iconic logo.  It was also the first florist to offer delivery in the country and first to have a walk in showroom.  Little did the company know; Mr. Bazinet was about to plant a seed that would bloom in to a large part of Bachman’s business.  So big, that it would, eventually, spin off in to its own company in 1982 and make Bachman’s renowned for something else… the founder of Christmas villages!

		<br />
		<br />
		Most would agree that Department 56 is a peculiar name for a company.  Though it sounds truly fine to us diehards, now, it was based on the department number of the wholesale gift import division in Bachman’s accounting system.  The primary focus of this division was fine Italian baskets.  Had things been different and the department referred to by another number, who knows, our beloved collectibles could have ended up as Department 25 or 66 for that matter!

		<br />
		<br />
		Over the years, many companies have attempted to capitalize on the overwhelming success of Department 56.  However, the company continues to stand second to none in design, innovation and preference amongst those who seek the finest quality in lit- houses and holiday giftware.  All Department 56 lit houses bear a bottom stamp or sticker with the company logo, name of the piece and year of copyright which serves as a seal of quality assurance and genuineness.    From all accounts this prestigious reputation will continue; as new design techniques and technology will allow for more intricately designed items.

		<strong>The Original Snow Village Collection
</strong>
<br />
		Known for its ceramic glazed finish, snowy roofs, attached trees and substantial size, The Original Snow Village Collection is a tribute to the memories that were stirred that snowy night about typical Main Street, USA.  Said to be reminiscent of the nostalgic period from the 1930’s- 1950’s, it has grown from very crude designs into the most intricately sculpted items in the industry.  
		<br />
		<br />
		The introduction of the first six buildings, in 1976, captured not only the imagination of the artists who created them, but the countless collectors who grew to treasure them.  The fire was lit and the true frenzy began following the retirement of the first group of buildings offered between 1976-77, in 1979.  Creating a collectible, however, was accidental, as the original intent was to make room for twelve new additions in the line.  1979 also brought the introduction of people in to the village.

		<br />
		<br />
		As the snowy little community grew, so did the fascination of the collector base!  Buildings, through the years, have become more refined; somewhat down- sized and the details more finessed.  Many attachments and add- ons from chimneys to window displays soon became commonplace.  The Original Snow Village Collection, to date, has become home to more buildings licensed by major corporations than any other has.  Prominent in past and present day, these companies rank amongst some of the most recognizable name brands in the country, and for that matter the world.  Businesses such as McDonald’s, Hershey’s, Starbucks, Coca- Cola, Harley- Davidson and the Campbell Soup Company have been incorporated into the village.  

		<br />
		<br />
		In 1998, a remarkable event took place in The Original Snow Village Collection, the snow melted and fall set into the suburbs.  Halloween, another one of the most celebrated holidays in The United States, became part of the landscape!  Featuring the same traditional ceramic glazed finish and footprint, Department 56 thought it only natural to put this new line under The Original Snow Village umbrella.  In short order, ghouls, goblins, trick or treators and haunted houses began popping up on the outskirts of town.  This new collection was met with great fanfare and took, what was until then, a traditional Christmas community, in a whole new direction.   Later years would bring additions to celebrate Valentine’s Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Easter and the Fourth of July.

		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>The Heritage Village Collection
</strong>
<br />
		The overwhelming success of The Original Snow Village Collection, led to the development and introduction of The Heritage Village Collection in 1984.  Through the creative designs of Master Architect Neilan Lund and his wife Ruth, this collection of lit- houses featured a smaller scale of architecture and a non- glazed porcelain finish, which provided for smaller accessories and greater detail.  This offering was significantly different than The Original Snow Village in that The Heritage Village Collection buildings were to focus on designs that were unique to definitive periods of time and/or geographical areas beyond Main Street, USA.  Most of the buildings, in this category, regardless of their intended conception, are very easily, and often, intermingled by collectors.  

		<br />
		<br />
		First out of the kiln, in this new collection, was the Dickens’ Village Series.  It was launched with seven little proprietary shops and a church.  The basis of this offering was reminiscent of Victorian England during the life and times of the famed British author, Charles Dickens.  It would grow to include buildings significant to Dickens himself such as his own home 
		<em>Gad’s Hill Place</em> and his personal writing studio <em>Gad’s Hill Chalet</em>, which was located across the street.

		<br />
		<br />
		Several of the buildings were to be designed after those referred to in his writings such as 
		<em>Nicholas Nickelby</em>, T<em>he Old Curiosity Shop</em> and <em>David Copperfield</em>.  But the true sub-series and anchor would have to be based on the holiday classic 
		<em>A Christmas Carol</em>.  Since its inception, Dickens’ Village Series has grown to include many famous historical landmarks such as the 
		<em>Tower of London, Big Ben, Shakespeare’s Old Globe Theater, Kensington Palace</em> and 
		<em>St. Martin-in-the-Fields Church</em>. 

		<br />
		<br />
		As with The Original Snow Village Collection, the collecting fury began after the retirement of the original set of Dickens’ Village buildings.  Following the retirement of a little known released, hand numbered, limited edition, entitled 
		<em>The Village Mill</em> the interest intensified and a new collectible was born.  Subsequently, as the first village collection to offer a hand numbered limited edition building, Department 56 has released more limited editions and limited to year of production pieces, in to this second most collected series, than any other.  It has also become home to the first offered hand numbered limited edition accessory.

		<br />
		<br />
		Though actual production numbers of the other buildings have never been disclosed, limited editions have grown to parallel a percentage of the actual collector base.  Ranging in numbers from 2,500 to 35,000, the retirement of pieces such as 
		<em>The Village Mill, Norman Church</em> and <em>Ramsford Palace</em> have fueled many a collector’s heart palpitations.  Met by parking lot exchanges and nation wide retailer searches, it also led to the development of a secondary market; which focused exclusively on Department 56 village related products.  

		<br />
		<br />
		With the incredible following of the Original Snow Village Collection and the Dickens’ Village Series, under its belt, Department 56 began to focus on the development of two new extensions of The Heritage Village Collection.  In 1986, New England Village Series and Alpine Village Series were introduced.  New England Village was to depict life in the American northeast during the early 1900’s.  Its focus would be on a more rural and rustic way of life highlighting the areas, churches, lighthouses and seafaring way of life.  Alpine Village Series would be reminiscent of life in the alps and countryside of Austria and Switzerland.  Alpine Village Series would later grown to incorporate licensed pieces associated with the popular musical 
		<em>The Sound of Music</em>.  Both collections have grown quite slowly in comparison to the first two and all others to date.  However, they both have featured their own hand numbered limited edition pieces and are beginning to gain momentum with an increase in introductions.

		<br />
		<br />
		Capitalizing on the success of the heart of rural London, it was only natural that Department 56 should move in to the city.  In 1987, the Christmas In The City Series was incorporated in to the Heritage Village Collection.  The Christmas In The City Series was to focus on the hustle and bustle of the holiday season in the heart of a major metropolitan area.  From three and four story high rise buildings, to those highlighting downtown shops and theaters, Christmas In The City was long believed, by collectors, to be a depiction of New York City at the turn of the century.  The collection has grown to confirm this with the release of such buildings as the famous 
		<em>Times Tower, Radio City Music Hall</em> and <em>Empire State Building</em> to name a few.
		<br />
		<br />
		This unique set of buildings featured sleek designs with their own sidewalks and corner buildings as part of its landscape.  This way, a collector could create actual city blocks.  Christmas In The City proved to be a favorite of those collectors who did not have room for the many previously issued buildings in The Original Snow Village Collection.  The newer sleek porcelain designs allowed for the display of many buildings in a smaller area due to its smaller footprint.  It was also very attractive in the fact that after the surge of interest, in those previously released collections; a secondary market had been established which was commanding very inflated prices for those pieces.  Also, with the release of this inner city series of buildings, a whole new target market had been reached.  Another positive factor was that a complete set was easily acquired at more reasonable prices.  

		<br />
		<br />
		In 1991 an incredible village first took place in this series.  Production of the 
		<em>Cathedral Church of St. Mark</em>, originally conceived to be a Dickens’ Village church, was halted at 3,024 pieces shortly after it went in to production.  It was intended to be an early release to the Gift Creation Concepts buying group as a hand numbered limited edition of 17,500.  During production, the piece encountered numerous problems including very concave towers and firing cracks due to its size.  A piece in near mint condition is very sought after.

		<br />
		<br />
		In 1990, the magical bridge between those who favored the ceramic glazed buildings of The Original Snow Village and the smaller porcelain buildings of The Heritage Village Collection was built.  The highly attractive North Pole Series was unveiled and met with the overwhelming excitement of even Santa, himself!  Not to mention that it would capitalize on the faithful following established by the previously issued villages!  

		<br />
		<br />
		With glittering snowy roofs and small stacks of wood as part of each building’s design, this whimsical winter community caught the eyes of every collector and even those not reached before.  The omnipresent personage of Santa also appears in several variations and scenarios throughout the frosty community.  Anyone and everyone, who loved Christmas, fell head over heels in love with the North Pole Series and its busy elfin community.  Department 56 had finally developed a concept that would appeal to all!  Even major corporations recognized the success and potential of this new offering.  In short order, licensed pieces by Binney & Smith (Crayola), LEGO, Mattel (Barbie) and Warner Brothers began arriving at the North Pole.

		<br />
		<br />
		In 1998, a small suburb to the North Pole Series, known as Elf Land, emerged.  These dwellings and businesses, with mushroom domed roofs and gold bells, established a place where the elves, themselves, lived in commune.  In 2001, Avon offered the first company exclusive building to this tiny neighborhood and for that matter, any village series, with the release of 
		<em>North Pole Beauty Shop</em>.  This piece was sold exclusively through the Avon catalogs distributed by the sales force.




		<br />
		<br />
		The year 2000 brought a further extension of the North Pole Series.  It was called North Pole Woods and featured a small treetop community of unique buildings built amongst the branches of differently designed cold cast porcelain trees.  It also has its own unique set of elves bearing acorn style caps.  It also marked the appearance of another Christmas celebrity, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  Even with the emergence of Rudolph, this part of the icy establishment received a very lukewarm reception.  The entire sub series was retired in 2002.

		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>The Little Town of Bethlehem</strong>
<br />
		In 1987, Department 56 created its own interpretation of the birth of Jesus.  With the holiday season as its core strategy, it was only natural to market those who celebrated the true meaning of Christmas.  In the beginning this was done with an inclusive collection featuring three lighted pieces and nine figurines.  

		<br />
		<br />
		Recognizing the following of Fontanini and the success of its own efforts, Department 56 retired the original set in 1999 and reissued a new updated and expanded collection of buildings and accessories to be known as The Holy Land Series.  Its focus would go beyond the birth of Christ in to Easter as well as encompassing other famous stories of the Bible.

		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Disney Park Village</strong>
<br />
		Ever looking for opportunity to tap into a broader base, Department 56 entered in to a licensing agreement with the Disney Corporation in 1994.  In conceived a series of buildings that would mirror those found in the magical kingdoms of Walt Disney World and Disneyland.  Its residents would include the famous couple of Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The agreement between the two companies was soon thrown in to peril when Disney began renovating and changing not only the physical design of the buildings, but their names as well.  The very buildings agreed upon no longer existed.

		<br />
		<br />
		As a selling point, it was established that Disney Parks Village would be marketed and sold at the Disney Parks and through the established Department 56 retail accounts, with two varying bottom stamps.  Though there was to be variation in the design of the buildings purchased at the Disney Parks; however, they would be marked by the Disney Holiday Collection emblem to designate their uniqueness.  In baseball terms, it was a double play!  Visitors to the parks would have a unique souvenir and those who could not could make the pilgrimage to America’s number one playground, could create their own fantasyland.  

		<br />
		<br />
		Hoping to capitalize on the popular following of all things Disney, a tremendous inventory of the Disney Park Village began amassing at Department 56 retailers.  But, collectors favored those offered at the parks over the ones offered through the regular accounts.  With all of the givens, the Disney Park Village became the first entire series to be retired at one time.  It had a very short shelf life that lasted from 1994-1996.



		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Seasons Bay</strong>
<br />
		During the 1990’s collector began a desire for a group of buildings that could be displayed longer than just during the holiday season, without snow and with proportional accessories to the buildings.  Up until this point the ceramic and porcelain accessories of the previous collections were not proportional to the doorways.  Ever in tune with the desires of its collectors and attempting to reach new collectors, Department 56 set out to target this desire.  By 1998, Seasons Bay Series was in production.  

		<br />
		<br />
		Reminiscent of seaside resort beach areas located on the eastern coast during the late 19th century, it would be the first time a collection would have interchangeable seasonal accessories that would represent all celebrations of the year. These new accessories would mark the first time that pewter would be used as a medium.  This would allow for a more proportional accessory to the building and greater detail.  The first buildings were also released in two editions.  Those in the first year would bear gold flags on their rooftops and subsequent years would not. 

		<br />
		<br />
		Seasons Bay Series, in very short order, had several hand- numbered limited editions.  But even with this, as the four seasons changed, so did collector enthusiasm.  Seasons Bay Series did not prove to appeal to a wide market as originally thought.  For the second time in village history an entire collection was retired in 2002.

		<strong>Profiles Department 56
</strong>
<br />
		In a remarkable marketing strategy, Department 56 decided to pursue the corporate gift ware market with easily recognizable brand name companies.  And with what better means than with the capitalization of its village success!  1996 brought the first in this line with the Heinz House for the H. J. Heinz corporation.  This agreement proved to be so successful that other buildings and accessories evolved.  Other companies such as State Farm insurance and Wells Fargo quickly followed suit.

		<br />
		<br />
		Intended as a way to reward stockholders and such, it didn’t take long before collectors scrambled to purchase the easily incorporated buildings of this group for their collections.  Was this an accident?  Not in the least!

		By 1986, village production was in full force and Department 56 needed more than little lit houses in order to prosper.  As a full- blown shareholder owned company, Department 56 had to find new ways to grow the business.  Many new and innovative items would have to be produced to meet this challenge.

		<strong>Babes and Bunnies
</strong>
<br />
		In 1984, through the creative juices of Bill Kirchner, then Director of Advertising and Product Development and Kristi Jensen Pierro, then a free lance artist for the company, the Snowbabies figurines evolved.  Depicting all of the innocence of young children and gender neutral, these little folks, who lived on a magical snowflake, became an instant hit!  In 2000, they met up with their country cousins known as Babes on the Farm who were the same basic characters with unique red parkas.

		<br />
		<br />
		As with any good thing, it was determined that the Snowbabies had to appeal to a broader market and capitalize on something other than the holidays.  In 2002, the Snowbabies Let’s Pretend Collection was released.  This would also feature the Snowbabies figurines showing more of their unique personalities through dress up, just like real kids do!  A concept that could be marketed year round!

		<br />
		<br />
		Just like the successful spawning of the other villages after the Original Snow Village, it wasn’t long until Department 56 realized that it had a hit with the Snowbabies and hopped in to Easter.  With the addition of a few ears, in 1994, Snowbabies became Snowbunnies.  Now, another market was tapped!  Just as with the concept of their winter cousins, these spring creatures could frolic and play with the same simplicity of a child.  Another ball out of the park!

		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Storybook Village Collection
</strong>
<br />
		One thing about Department 56 is that it continually plays off of its accomplishments.  Recognizing the success of childhood memories through the Snowbabies and villages, it was only fitting that the Storybook Village Collection would evolve!  Now the best of both worlds combined in to one!  And what better way than through the childhood stories we all grew up with?  Artist license played off of these age- old stories we all grew up with.  Through the lighted cold cast porcelain houses of imagination we could create vignettes of those places where our favorite childhood characters lived.  This collection eventually grew to incorporate everything from teapots to nightlights and ornaments.

		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Other Department 56 Collectibles
</strong>
<br />
		Through the years, Department 56 has repeatedly strived to capitalize on its faithful following as well as market new collectors.  With chubby little monks known as 
		<em>Merry Makers</em>, teddy bears known as <em>Upstairs Downstairs Bears</em> and an excited family based on “Twas The Night Before Christmas” known as 
		<em>All Through The House</em>, this has been accomplished. Snowbabies Artist Kristi Jensen Pierro, as the creative lead, oversaw these popular giftware additions.

		<br />
		<br />
		For those who embraced a traditional sense of the Christmas Season, beyond the villages, Department 56 created an upscale offering of white figurines.  This white, silhouetted collection has been known by the names of L<em>amplighter 
		Collection, Winter Silhouettes </em>and<em> Silhouette Treasures</em>, all based on the Christmas Season.  It spun off new concepts to celebrate the birth of children and weddings through the lines of 
		<em>Lullababies</em> and <em>Love Inc</em>.

		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>Licensing
</strong><br />
		As previously referenced, in an effort to reach collectors where they were, Department 56 has continue to expand licensing to include numerous village designs inspired by Christmas  movies and television shows centered around Charlie Brown and friends, Disney, Tim Burton’s Nightmare Before Christmas, A Christmas Story, Elf, Dr. Seuss and the very successful National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation. More recent introductions have been focused on the Harry Potter franchise, Game of Thrones, the Ghostbuster movies, and the popular television show Friends. Iconic brands including the likes of Dairy Queen, Harley-Davidson, Crayola, and Coca-Cola have found their way into numerous different village collection.
		<br />
		<br />
		If the past is any indication, Department 56 will continue to strive to reach out to any and all that may or may not be familiar with its reputation.  As long as there are holidays and occasions to celebrate you can count on the Department 56 Creative Team to introduce exciting new collections.
